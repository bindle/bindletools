.SH NAME
bindle_dirname, bindle_dirname_r - Bindle Binary Tools string routines

.SH LIBRARY
Bindle Binaries Tools (libbindle, -lbindle)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include\fR \fB<bindle.h>\fR
.sp
.BI "char * bindle_dirname( const char * " path " );"
.sp
.BI "char * bindle_dirname_r( const char * " path ", char * " dname ","
.BI "           size_t " dnamelen " );"
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBbindle_dirname\fR() function returns a pointer to the parent directory
of the pathname pointed to by \fIpath\fR. If \fIpath\fR is a NULL, an empty
string, or does not contain a `/' character, the string "." is returned.
\fBbindle_dirname\fR() uses a static buffer and does not modify the value of
\fIpath\fR. \fBbindle_dirname_r\fR() uses the buffer referenced by \fIdname\fR
of \fIdnamelen\fR bytes instead of an internal buffer, but is otherwise
identical to \fBbindle_dirname\fR().

.SH RETURN VALUES
\fBbindle_dirname\fR() and \fBbindle_dirname_r\fR() return a pointer to the
string containing the parent directy of the pathname pointed to by \fIpath\fR.
