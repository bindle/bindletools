.SH NAME
bindle_getpass, bindle_getpass_r - Bindle Binary Tools string routines

.SH LIBRARY
Bindle Binaries Tools (libbindle, -lbindle)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include\fR \fB<bindle.h>\fR
.sp
.BI "char * bindle_getpass( const char * " prompt " );"
.sp
.BI "char * bindle_getpass_r( const char * " prompt ", char * " pass ", size_t " passlen " );"

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbindle_getpass\fR() and \fBbindle_getpass_r\fR() attempt to open \fI/dev/tty\fR
for reading and writing.  If \fI/dev/tty\fR is not accessible, \fIstdin\fR and
\fIstdout\fR are used. \fBbindle_getpass\fR() and \fBbindle_getpass_r\fR()
display \fIprompt\fR.
.sp
\fBbindle_getpass\fR() reads up to \fBBNDL_PASSWORD_LEN\fR bytes of user input
to an internal buffer. \fBbindle_getpass_r\fR() reads up to \fIpasslen\fR bytes
of user input to the buffer pointed to by \fIpass\fR.

.SH RETURN VALUES
The \fBbindle_getpass\fR() and \fBbindle_getpass_r\fR() functions return a
pointer to the null terminated password.
