.SH DESCRIPTION
 To be written.

.SH RETURN VALUES
\fBbindle_bsearch\fR() returns \fINULL\fR if an error occurs, otherwise a
pointer to the object is returned. \fBbindle_bindex\fR() returns -1 if
a matching object was not found, otherwise the index position of the requested
object is returned.
.sp
Upon success, \fBbindle_badd\fR() returns the index position of the object
added to the array, otherwise -2 is returned if a memory error occured or -1
is returned for all other errors.
.sp
\fBbindle_bremove\fR returns a pointer to the removed object if successful,
otherwise NULL is returned.
