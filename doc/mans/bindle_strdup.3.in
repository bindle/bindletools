.SH NAME
bindle_strdup, bindle_strndup - Bindle Binary Tools string routines

.SH LIBRARY
Bindle Binaries Tools (libbindle, -lbindle)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include\fR \fB<bindle.h>\fR
.sp
.BI "char * bindle_strdup( const char * " s1 " );"
.sp
.BI "char * bindle_strndup( const char * " s1 ", size_t " n " );"
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbindle_strdup\fR() and \fBbindle_strndup\fR() allocate memory, copies
the string \fIs1\fR to the newly allocated memory, and returns a pointer to
the allocated memory. The memory referenced by the returned pointer must be
freed using \fBfree\fR(). \fBbindle_strndup\fR() will allocate at most \fIn\fR
bytes of memory and copy at most \fIn\fR - 1 characters from \fIs1\fR to the
allocated memory.

\fBbindle_strdup\fR() and \fBbindle_strndup\fR() are based on the functions
\fBstrdup\fR() and \fBstrndup\fR() from 4.4BSD and FreeBSD 7.2.

.SH RETURN VALUES
\fBbindle_strdup\fR() and \fBbindle_strndup\fR() return a pointer to the
allocated memory. If sufficient memory is not available, then NULL is
returned and errno is set to ENOMEM.
