.SH NAME
bindle_strsplit - Bindle Binary Tools string routines

.SH LIBRARY
Bindle Binaries Tools (libbindle, -lbindle)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include\fR \fB<bindle.h>\fR
.sp
.BI "int bindle_strsplit( const char * " str ", int " delim ", char *** " argvp ","
.BI "           int * " argcp " );"

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBbindle_strsplit\fR() function splits \fIstr\fR into multiple strings
using \fIdelim\fR as the delimiter.  The resulting strings are stored as a
NULL terminated array which must be freed using \fBbindle_strsfree\fR().
\fIargvp\fR is updated with a reference to the results array and \fIargc\fR is
updated with the number of strings in the results array.

.SH RETURN VALUES
The \fBbindle_strsplit\fR() function returns 0 on success or one of the
error codes listed in errno(2) if an error occurs.
